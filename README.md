# MNIST-Fashion-Classification-with-TensorFlow

This repository contains a notebook with basic implementation of CNN image classification algorithms using TensorFlow for the MNIST Fashion dataset. This dataset is built into Keras and can be loaded using the load_data function on tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist

Two models are created and evaluated:

  1. Model without regularization 
  2. Model with regularization

The notebook also distribution bar chart of each of the prediction distribution.

Your feedback to improve the model is always welcome. Thanks!
